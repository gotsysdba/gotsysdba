### Hi there 👋
> :warning:  I am employed by Oracle, however, all code found in this repository is proof-of-concept, used primarily for demonstration purposes, and is **not** supported by Oracle.  The code here should **not** be used, as is, for Production purposes... otherwise, enjoy!

#### Yet Another Repository...
You may have stumbled here on accident or directed here after a demonstration, either way, thank you for browsing.  What you will find here is code related to my exploration and obsession with automation, specifically around [Oracle Cloud Infrastructure](cloud.oracle.com) databases.  While, as a DBA, shell-scripting is more of my forte, I am attempting to learn other languages; please don't judge too harshly.. feedback to improve the code will be appreciated.

#### Who are you? Who are you?
An Oracle DBA, a self-proclaimed "citizen developer", an amature brewer and known over-user of the "dot-dot-dot"...  

- 🌱 I’m currently learning [Python](www.python.org), [Terraform](www.terraform.io), [Liquibase](www.liquibase.org) and how-to BIAB.
