### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
<span style="color:red">*DISCLAIMER:*</span> I am employeed by Oracle, however, all code found in this repository is proof-of-concept, used primarily for demonstration purposes, and is **not** supported by Oracle.  The code here should **not** be used, as is, for Production purposes... otherwise, enjoy!

#### Yet Another Repository...
You may have stumbled here on accident or directed here after a demonstration, either way, thank you for browsing.  What you will find here is code related to my exploration and obsession with automation, specifically around Oracle Cloud Infrastructure databases.  While, as a DBA, shell-scripting is more of my forte, I am attempting to learn other languages; please don't judge too harshly.. feedback to improve the code will be appreciated.

#### Who are you? Who are you?
An Oracle DBA, a self-proclaimed "citizen developer", an amature brewer and known to over use the "dot-dot-dot"...  

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning python, terraform, Oracle Cloud Infrastucture resources and howto BIAB.
